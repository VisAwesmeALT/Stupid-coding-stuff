.CREDITS (and the usual stupid humor...)
If you reuse or remake this script, credit DrKel or visawesme. And if you steal it and claim it as yours, expect a DMCA notice (or at least some serious side-eye).
Horrible code written by Dr. Kel, who loves VoTV so much they started pretending to be Kel (NOT THE KEL FROM OMORI, THE ONE FROM VOICES OF THE VOID).
-- Yeah, I’m not okay.
This script is not responsible for any damage to your system, your sanity, or your cat’s trust in you.
If you experience issues, please contact your local IT department, or better yet, a therapist.
Seriously, don’t run this on your main machine unless you’re ready for the game "Will it boot tomorrow?"

.DANGER
Very dangerous script—this could potentially cause more damage than MEMZ itself.
If you're running this in VMware or VirtualBox, remember: VM escapes are a thing.
.Use Triage if you have a lifetime to spare, but don’t be surprised if your account gets an 8-hour review delay.
.SUPERDUPERIMPORTANT
This script is intended for highly controlled environments (e.g., a triage VM or a random computer found under a table).
It forcefully terminates processes, deletes files, and removes persistence mechanisms associated with MEMZ.exe and its variants.
.IMPORTANT
Before running, set the execution policy:
  Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
(Side note: don’t blame me if this turns your computer into a toaster.)
.SYNOPSIS
Forcefully terminates all processes matching MEMZ variants, removes persistence mechanisms, and aggressively strips process privileges.
.DESCRIPTION
This script hunts for processes with names like MEMZ.exe, memez.exe, etc. It uses background jobs to kill them, attempts to remove all persistence (scheduled tasks, registry entries, and shadow copies), and calls a custom .NET function to strip privileges from those processes.
.NOTES
Run this script as Administrator.
WARNING: This script is like a wrecking ball—you might lose files and system stability you didn’t know you loved.
